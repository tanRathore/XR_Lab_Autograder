The sections are labeled with headers like \"Step 1: Personal Information,\" \"Step 2: 10 famous buildings,\" \"Step 3: Bibliography,\" and \"Step 4: Reference.\" However, there's no table of contents.\n",

      "Justification: The biographical content appears in the \"Step 3: Bibliography\" section. While the section *is* biographical, it is out of place. Also, this section is only around 300 words, so this does not meet the word count requirements. It does generally touch on the achievements and significance of Niemeyer, but does not detail the architect's education or discuss typologies.\n",

      "Justification: The submission includes images for all 10 buildings, which meets the quantity requirement. While the buildings have both interior and exterior shots, most do not have the minimum requirements of 3+ exterior and 5+ interior images. Image quality varies, with some being high-resolution and others showing pixelation, though most are generally adequate.\n",

Instead of just the URL, a proper citation format (even a simplified one) would be better. There are also inconsistencies with these URLS, as some seem to be direct image links, and others link to the website where the image was sourced.\n",

      "**9. Personal Bio & Photo**\n",
      "Justification: A personal photo and a short bio are included at the beginning of the document. The placement is correct (after where a table of contents would be) and the bio provides some context about the student's interest in architecture, though the photo is casual rather than professional.\n",

      "Justification: The submission is somewhat complete in that it covers all required elements, but the presentation needs improvement. The layout is basic, and the lack of a table of contents and the misplaced biographical content detract from the overall polish. The use of simple URLs as citations, instead of proper referencing also makes the document look less professional.\n",

      "**1. Architect Selection & Scope**\n",
      "Justification: The student chose Oscar Niemeyer, who is a well-known architect. Assuming this architect is included in \"Book Two\" (which I cannot verify), the selection is appropriate and clearly stated.\n",
      "Score: 5/5\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Organization & Document Setup**\n",
      "Justification: The document is *partially* organized. There is a rudimentary list of buildings, and a section for the student bio. However, there is no Table of Contents, and there are no clear headers for the biography, building descriptions, or reference sections *in the main body*. The student uses titles such as \"Step 1: Personal Information,\" which is an odd, informal approach. This needs a formal Table of Contents (which is missing) and better section labeling.\n",
      "Score: 2/5\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Biographical Content (750 words)**\n",
      "Justification: The biographical content appears across two sections (\"Step 1: Personal Information\" + \"Step 3: Bibliography\"). It's hard to gauge the precise word count, but it seems to reach the minimum. The student covers Niemeyer's lifespan, nationality, and some details about his style, but misses out on education information. The content focuses on Niemeyer's political beliefs and how they affected his architecture. However, the content is very generalized and would benefit from more specific examples.\n",

      "\n",
      "**4. Citation of Architect Biography**\n",
      "Justification: The \"Reference\" section has a list of sources, however, none of them are cited *within* the main text. This is a major issue. The references are also formatted inconsistently; some are properly formatted (e.g., Frampton) and some are not. Most are just URLs. No DOIs, citation counts, or proper APA formatting. This area is severely lacking.\n",
      "Score: 1/5\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Selection & Quality of Images**\n",
      "Justification: The student includes images for 10 buildings. However, they're not properly integrated into the biographical section. While some buildings have at least 3 exterior and 5 interior images, there are many that fall short of this requirement, and image quality varies.\n",
      "Score: 3/5\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Image Citation & Attribution**\n",
      "Justification: All images have a URL attribution below them, which is good. However, they are inconsistent; the student does not appear to be following any particular style guide. URLs are simply listed.\n",
      "Score: 4/5\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. Coverage of 10 Famous Buildings**\n",
      "Justification: The student lists 10 buildings with their location and a brief statement on their significance under \"Step 2: 10 famous buildings\". However, this is presented as a search query with suggested \"image selection criteria\", not as proper architectural writing. The significance statements are extremely short and superficial.\n",

      "**8. Image Relevance**\n",
      "Justification: Generally, the images are relevant to the buildings they are associated with. However, without descriptive text *alongside* the images, it is difficult to fully appreciate their architectural value within the document. The format (images clumped *after* the text-based query section) also detracts from the overall quality.\n",

      "**10. Overall Completeness & Presentation**\n",
      "Justification: The submission is far from being polished. The organization is poor, with a missing Table of Contents and an informal \"step\" based structure. The lack of in-text citations and the poor formatting of the reference list significantly impact the credibility of the work. The layout is also weak; the images are presented in a block *after* the initial building descriptions. A better approach would be to discuss each building, accompanied by relevant images and captions.\n",
